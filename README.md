Coding tasks from a Java hands-on certification

Task 1
--------

public static String getBinaryRepresentation(int n) {
		/*
		 * Please implement this method to return a String with the binary
		 * representation of any number n, where n >= 0. Example: "101" is a
		 * binary representation of 5
		 */
}

Task 2
--------

public static double getProbability(int Y, int X) {
		/*
		 * If you roll Y standard six-sided dice, whatâ€™s the probability that
		 * you get at least X 4s? To calculate that you should divide the number
		 * of comibnations with X or more 4s by the total number of possible
		 * combinations.
		 */
}

Task 3
--------

public static Change getCorrectChange(int cents) {
		/*
		 * Please implement this method to take cents as a parameter and return
		 * an equal amount in dollars and coins using the minimum number of
		 * coins possible. For example: 164 cents = 1 dollar, 2 quarters, 1 dime
		 * and 4 cents. Return null if the parameter is negative.
		 */
}

Task 4
--------

public static int getLargestRootToLeafSum(Node root) {
		/*
		 * A root-to-leaf path in a tree is a path from a leaf node through all
		 * its ancestors to the root node inclusively. A "root-to-leaf sum" is a
		 * sum of the node values in a root-to-leaf path.
		 * 
		 * Please implement this method to return the largest root-to-leaf sum
		 * in the tree.
